# import
import my_file

# print(my_file.x,my_file.y)
# print(my_file.x + my_file.y)

# Keywords
import keyword

# print("***************There are total",len(keyword.kwlist),"keywords******************")
# print("\n")
# print(keyword.kwlist)

# [NOTE]---> [By observing the above keyword list we see that there is three different keywords by its look which is 'False', 'None', 'True' these three have first letter is capital and remaining all others are first letter is in lowercase]
# 'None' ---> similar to NULL (in c++)

# OPERATORS

# 1. Arithmetic Operators --> [**, /, //, *, %, +, -]

# print(2**64)
# print(3/4) # true division operator (always give answer in float)
# print(10/5)
print(55//19) # floor division operator (give result according to the given operands same as C language division operator)
print(55//19.4)
print(3.0//4,"\n")
print(-18//4)
print(-17//4)
print(-17.5//4)
print(18//4)

# print(5 % 3)   # Modulus operator
# print(3.5 % 2)

# 2. Relational Operator --> [>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=]
# print(5>55)
# print(19 < 45,"\n")


# print(5<6<7)
# print(55>44>33)
# print(3>1>2,"\n")

# 3. logical operator--> [not, or, and]

# print(not 3<4)
# print(3>0 and 4>0)
# print(3>0 or 1>3,"\n")

## Examples
# print("Seeta" or "Geeta")
# print("Ram" and "Shyam")
# print(3 and 4)
# print(0 and 5)
# print(0 or 5,"\n")

# 4. Bitwise Operator --> [&, |, ^, ~, >>, <<]
# print(3 & 4)
# print(3 | 4,"\n")

# 5. Assignment Operator --> [=, +=, -=, /=, //=, %=, **=, *=, &-=, |=, ^=, >>=, =<<]

# a=5,b=6,c=7 # Give Error
# a,b,c = 5,6,7
# print(a,b,c,"\n")

# 6. Identity Operator --> [ is, is not]
# x = 5
# y = 5
# print(id(x))
# print(id(y))

# print(x is y)
# y = 6
# print(x is not y,"\n")

# 7. Membership Operator --> [in, not in]

# y = "mysirg"
# print("my" in y,"\n")


# INPUT ----> input()

#print("Enter your name : ")
# x = input("Enter your name : ")
# print("Hello ",x)
